#HiveOS instructions
#Install deps

#If you get an error about libssl, first install all the others:
apt-get install build-essential automake libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev libnuma-dev git

#Then you have to use a different command.  likely, this will force a downgrade of HiveOS to resolve the conflict
#   You should be able to update after compiling..
#   When you run this, the first option will be to not install, type N and hit enter to not accept
#   The second will be to downgrade Hive and then install, hit Y and hit enter.
aptitude install libssl-dev

#check your version of g++ and gcc
gcc --version
g++ --version

#Both need to be >=8.  If not update.
apt install gcc-8
apt install g++-8

#gcc-10 and g++10 produce slightly faster code, but I am unable to get them installed on HiveOS
#let me know if you can get it to work.

#change the links in /usr/bin to point to the new compilers
rm /usr/bin/gcc
rm /usr/bin/g++
ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-8 /usr/bin/gcc
ln -s /usr/bin/g++-8 /usr/bin/g++

#now attempt to compile:
git clone https://github.com/Owesatuma/cpuminer-gr-devfee
cd cpuminer-gr-devfee
./build.sh

#if you downgraded HiveOS to install libssl, then you can upgrade back
selfupgrade --force

#if compiled successfully, you should see the executible cpuminer in the directory.
#copy that to the HiveOS miner directory. modify path as needed

cp cpuminer /hive/miners/cpuminer-opt/gr/1.2.4.1

#assuming HiveOS is using the cpuminer.sh shell script to decide on a version, you need to overwrite that
nano cpuminer.sh

#On line 12 or so change ./cpuminer-${1} to ./cpuminer  (no "-${1})
#Your previous tune_config file should be OK, but retune if you like.
#restart your miner and verify it is running. 
miner restart; miner
